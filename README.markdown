       * /etc/bash_completion.d
       * /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
       * ~/bash_completion.d

    b. Or, copy it somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-flow-completion.sh) and put the following line in
       your .bashrc:

           source ~/.git-flow-completion.sh

	c. For Mac OS users, add the following lines to file `.profile` in your home directory:
	   
		   if [ -f /Users/bogdanovichiy/Projects/git-flow-completion/git-flow-completion.bash ]; then
